# Kaggle-Titanic
This project uses the training dataset to train a ML model to predict the survival of passengers in testing dataset. Both datasets are available at [Kaggle Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

## Contents
* train.csv: To train the data
* test.csv: To test the data and predict the outcome
* final.csv: Final outcome to be submitted
* Titanic.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for the code

## Dataset
* PassengerId: Id of the passenger
* Survived: Survival of the passenger (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
* Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
* Name: Name
* Sex: Sex
* Age: Age in years
* SibSp: Number of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic
* Parch: Number of parents / children aboard the Titanic
* Ticket: Ticket number
* Fare: Passenger fare
* Cabin: Cabin number
* Embarked: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

## Objective
To use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to gain an introductory exposure to Machine Learning Classification concepts along with data visualization. The project makes use of Scikit-Learn, Pandas and Data Visualization(Matplotlib and Seaborn) Libraries.
